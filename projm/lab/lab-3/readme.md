## Execution

### Roadmap Overview

A **Roadmap** is a high-level visual summary that maps out the project’s goals, milestones, and deliverables over a specific timeline. In this case, the project’s roadmap spans 25 months and involves the development of a low-complexity mobile banking application with AI-supported user behavior analysis.

The roadmap provides a clear understanding of the workflow, dependencies, and critical tasks. This approach helps ensure that all stakeholders have aligned expectations and facilitates efficient project execution by identifying risks and optimization opportunities.

### Gantt Diagram Explanation

The **Gantt diagram** is a bar chart used to represent the project schedule. It visually displays tasks, their durations, and dependencies over time. Each task is represented as a horizontal bar, with its length indicating its duration. For this project, the Gantt diagram includes:

- Modules and their respective areas, such as **Backend Development**, **Frontend Development**, and **AI Module Development**.
- Task dependencies, showing which tasks need to be completed before others can start.
- Overlaps and parallel tasks to optimize time and resource usage.

The Gantt diagram is critical for project management as it helps:

1. Visualize the entire project timeline.
2. Identify the critical path—the sequence of tasks that directly affect the project’s duration.
3. Allocate resources efficiently by recognizing bottlenecks and idle periods.
4. Monitor progress and adjust schedules as necessary.

### Roadmap Importance

A well-constructed roadmap is essential for several reasons:

- **Alignment**: Ensures all team members and stakeholders understand the project’s direction and priorities.
- **Clarity**: Breaks down complex projects into manageable phases, helping teams focus on key deliverables.
- **Risk Management**: Identifies potential risks early and provides a basis for contingency planning.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes the use of time and resources by highlighting dependencies and opportunities for parallel work.

### Addressing Resource and WBS Mismatch

During the planning phase, a discrepancy between the resource plan and the WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) became apparent. Initially, the project duration was estimated to be 25 months; however, after analyzing the tasks and creating the WBS, it was evident that the project could potentially be completed in around **40 weeks**. This shorter timeline was based on task dependencies and optimized parallel execution.

The difference in estimated time arises because the resource plan was based on hypothetical allocations for each team, while the WBS was derived from a task-based breakdown. Additionally, since I have limited experience working in a corporate environment and have mostly completed projects individually, the time estimates in the WBS are based on how long I would take to complete the tasks.

This results in a rough estimate, and the actual time needed for teams to complete tasks in a real-world scenario may be longer due to factors such as:

- Coordination between team members.
- Variability in task complexity.
- Unforeseen challenges.

Thus, while the roadmap attempts to align with the real-world duration of the project, it remains an estimate and will likely require adjustments during execution.
